dark activated terrace lamp 
A dark-activated terrace lamp is a light that turns on when it gets dark, such as at night. It can be useful for people who have difficulty walking or vision problems, and can help to illuminate a space. 
Dark-activated terrace lamps use a light sensor, such as a photoresistor, to detect light levels and turn the lamp on and off. Some dark-activated lamps can also include an alarm that sounds in the morning when daylight is detected. 


this devices allow one or more lamps to illuminated at sunset and turnoff at dawn
